Xikij
=====

Xikij (read "zicitch") is a Xiki clone.  It is written in coffee and
initially intended to be used with atom.

It is under development, so is this readme very short for now.

This is not yet a program running on its own.  It is a library still.

```
/home/kiwi
  $ ls -al

root@havanna:/var/deploy
  $ ls
```

TODO
----

xikij does not work on untitled file, because tries to read file path (atom-xikij)

Features
--------

- command line execution works
- SSH works
